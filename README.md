# TD3-AUTP-Simulation
This is the implementation of the research paper AoI-Energy-Aware UAV-Assisted Data Collection for IoT Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method done by me (Eshaan Sodhi) and my research partner(Dev Gupta). 
The requirements to be downloaded are mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Everything is to be run on python version 3.9.6
The main file to be run is model.py 
The file config.py contains the values for the hyperparameters 
The file greedy.py contains a greedy implementation of the problem to be compared
